# Imputed Deviation of Evolutionary Action Load (iDEAL) analysis of Alzheimer's disease


## Project Description
Despite considerable insight from GWAS and sequencing studies, much of late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) heritability remains unexplained leading to uncertain risk stratification of patients and no available disease-modifying therapies. To date, the APOE gene remains the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD. Carriers of the APOEɛ4 allele are at a greater risk, while the APOEɛ2 allele plays a protective role. However, many APOEɛ4 carriers remain disease-free and some APOEɛ2 carriers develop LOAD.

iDEAL, or imputed Deviation of Evolutionary Action Load, is a novel approach that identifies genes with differential mutational burden between the two paradoxical patient groups through a series of linear regression analyses.
